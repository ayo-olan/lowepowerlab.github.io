I am a plant pathologist and microbiologist driven to uncover the behavioral and fitness adaptations that allow bacteria to cause plant disease. My research lies at the intersection of molecular genetics, metabolism, and plant-microbe interactions. Although my research program centers on how the model wilt pathogen *Ralstonia solanacearum* exploits and thrives in the flowing plant xylem, the questions I address are broadly relevant to vascular and nonvascular plant pathogens.

My research focus is two pronged: it investigates how A.) xylem impact their host as well as how B.) the host environment shapes pathogen behavior. My work investigates metabolic and quorum sensing adaptations of xylem pathogens to agriculturally-relevant host plants.
