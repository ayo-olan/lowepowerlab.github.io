**BS Microbial Biology** UC Berkeley

Katie was a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow working with Dr. Lowe-Power in the Lindow lab at Berkeley to investigate <i>Ralstonia solacearum</i>'s growth requirements in tomato xylem sap. 

For fun: Rock climbing, baking bread, hiking
 
**What she did after the Lowe-Power lab**: In Fall 2019, Katie joined Dr. Dipti Nayak's lab at UC Berkeley where she is a research technician unraveling the mysteries of Archaea.
