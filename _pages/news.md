## Spring 2020

*March 27, 2020*

We've set a new lab motto for Spring 2020: **Constraints provide opportunities for Creativity!** Due to the Covid19 pandemic, our lab culled our tomato plants, archived our bacteria in the -80, donated our PPE stocks to UC Davis Med, and transitioned to remote work on March 13. Our first priority is health: infectious, physical, and mental. Our second priority is defining & carrying out training and research goals that we can complete remotely. 

## Winter 2020

Our lab is full of growth this quarter!  We welcome M.S. student **Jonathan Beutler**, postdoc **Brian Ingel**, and a dynamic duo of undergraduate researchers **Kyle Chipman** and **Elva Xian**. 

Jonathan enters our lab as member of the International Agriculture and Development graduate group.  Before starting at UC Davis in Fall 2019, Jonathan ran a turmeric farm in Hawaii. As a farmer, Jonathan had first-hand experience with Ralstonia.  Jonathan is conducting an a thesis evaluating Ralstonia management strategies.   

Brian joins us from Caroline Roper's lab at UC Riverside where he worked on the xylem-dweller Xylella fastidiosa.  

Stratton Georgoulis is mentoring the #wUndergrads Kyle and Elva through their first PCRs on route to cloning their first plasmids. As Global Disease Biology students, both Kyle and Elva will be completing research theses in our lab. 

## Fall 2019

Welcome Plant Pathology PhD student, **Stratton Georgoulis**, the first trainee of the lab! 

## Summer 2019

We have officially opened our doors at UC Davis!
