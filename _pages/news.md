Our lab is full of growth this quarter!  We welcome M.S. student **Jonathan Beutler**, postdoc **Brian Ingel**, and a dynamic duo of undergraduate researchers **Kyle Chipman** and **Elva Xian**. 

Jonathan enters our lab as member of the International Agriculture and Development graduate group.  Before starting at UC Davis in Fall 2019, Jonathan ran a turmeric farm in Hawaii.
