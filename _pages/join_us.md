We are happy to discuss opportunities with people motivated to understand how bacteria interact with their plant hosts. Expectations for members of the lab are described in the [Lowe-Power lab mentor/mentee contract](assets\resources\mentoring_contract_lowepowerlab.docx). The lab's [onboarding info / handbook](https://github.com/lowepowerlab/protocols/blob/master/onboarding.md) might also be of interest.
