We are happy to discuss opportunities with people motivated to understand how bacteria interact with their plant hosts. Expectations for members of the lab are described in the [Lowe-Power lab handbook](https://github.com/lowepowerlab/lab_handbook). The lab's [onboarding info](https://github.com/lowepowerlab/lab_handbook/blob/master/onboarding.md) might also be of interest. 

## Undergraduates

Undergraduate researchers are an important part of the Lowe-Power lab group. If you are an undergraduate student interested in our research and would like to conduct independent research or to contribute to our group's research mission through work-study, please [read this advice](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2015/05/dear-dr-neufeld) on writing professional emails and contact Dr. Lowe-Power. In the email, please include your year of study, your background including relevant coursework, and what interests you about our research. 

Current and prospective students are encouraged to apply for stipend funding through [UC Davis Undergraduate Research Programs](https://urc.ucdavis.edu/programs) or professional societies, such as the [American Phytopathological Society](https://www.asm.org/Fellowships/Undergraduate-Research-Fellowship) and the [American Society of Microbiology](https://www.asm.org/Fellowships/Undergraduate-Research-Fellowship). Additional funding opportunities: [Barudolph foundation](http://barudolphfoundation.org/stem-scholarship/).

## Graduates

We accept graduate students though several graduate groups, including [Plant Pathology](http://plantpathology.ucdavis.edu/gradindex.cfm), [Microbiology](https://mgg.ucdavis.edu/prospective-students), [Plant Biology](https://pbi.sf.ucdavis.edu/apply), and [Integrative Genetics and Genomics](https://igg.ucdavis.edu/). Application deadlines range from Dec 1 to early January. After applying, please email Dr. Lowe-Power with your CV and a statement describing your interest in our lab. If you are a current Davis graduate student interested in rotating, stop by my office or drop me an [email](mailto:tlowepower@ucdavis.edu). 

## Postdocs

I am interested in recruiting and mentoring talented, motivated, passionate postdocs. Please email a letter describing your research interests, career goals, what you hope to get out of the Lowe-Power lab, what you hope to bring to the Lowe-Power lab, and your CV. I am particularly interested in prospective postdocs who are interested in applying for fellowships such as [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/education.jsp?fund_type=3), [USDA](https://nifa.usda.gov/funding-opportunity/agriculture-and-food-research-initiative-education-workforce-development), [LSRF](http://www.lsrf.org/apply), [UC PPFP](https://ppfp.ucop.edu/info/), or [other fellowships](https://ecrcentral.org/fundings).
